Average grade: A+.</p>\n<p><strong>Master Thesis:</strong> <a href=\"https://issuu.com/skovhus/docs/string_comparison_on_gpus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Algorithms for String Comparison on GPUs</a>. Under the supervision of Inge Li G√∏rtz and Philip Bille (DTU Informatics), we considered parallelization of string comparison algorithms (including sequence alignment, edit distance, and longest common subsequence). We presented a novel approach for solving these problems using graphics processing units (GPUs) and showed a 40X speedup compared to a state-of-the-art sequential CPU solution. Grade: A+.</p>\n<p><strong>Courses of special interest:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>\n<li>Artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems</li>\n<li>Requirements Engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>B.Sc., Technical University of Denmark (2006-2009)</h3>\n<p>Software Technology.
